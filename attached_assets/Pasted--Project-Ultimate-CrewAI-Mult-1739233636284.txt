Project: Ultimate CrewAI Multi-Agent System Implementation
================================================================

Objective:
Develop a complete, production-ready, self-updating CrewAI multi-agent system that processes test requirements, generates and maps test cases, and supports querying of stored test cases. Every step is explicit and unambiguous.

Requirements:
--------------
1. Role-Based Agent Design:
   - Implement the following agent classes, each with a unique ID, role, goal, backstory, and settings (validated via pydantic):
       • DataCollectorAgent
       • AnalyzerAgent
       • StrategistAgent
       • ManagerAgent
       • ReporterAgent
       • RequirementInputAgent       # Receives and cleans raw test requirements and wireframes.
       • NLPParsingAgent             # Uses an LLM to extract structured details from cleaned requirements.
       • TestCaseMappingAgent        # Generates a formatted test case (e.g., in Gherkin or Zephyr Scale format).
       • ValidationAgent             # Validates that test cases contain required elements.
       • ChangeDetectionAgent        # Monitors stored wireframes/requirements for modifications.
       • TestCaseUpdateAgent         # Triggers re-generation of test cases when updates are detected.
       • StorageIntegrationAgent     # Stores final test cases in Zephyr Scale and in a vector database.
       • QueryInterfaceAgent         # Provides a conversational query interface for test cases.
       • FlowOrchestratorAgent       # Coordinates the entire workflow from input to storage.
       • LoggingAgent                # Logs every step of the process.

2. Autonomous Inter-Agent Delegation:
   - All agents must implement the methods:
       • execute_task(task)
       • delegate_task(task)
       • update_status()
       • handle_event(event)
   - The ManagerAgent (or FlowOrchestratorAgent) must coordinate delegation and reassign tasks if failures occur.

3. Flexible Task Management:
   - Define a Task model (using pydantic) with:
       • task_id, description, expected_output, execution mode (sync/async), priority, dependencies, timeout, and retry_policy.
   - Implement a TaskManager that schedules, executes, and retries tasks as defined.

4. Crew Formation & Task Flows:
   - Create a Crew class that groups agents.
   - Implement explicit methods:
       • assign_task(task) – Select agents based on role and availability.
       • kickoff() – Initiate the complete workflow.
   - The Crew class must also aggregate crew-level events and performance metrics.

5. Process Orchestration & Execution Strategies:
   - Implement an abstract ExecutionStrategy (using the Strategy pattern) with a method execute(tasks, agents).
   - Provide three concrete strategies:
       • SequentialStrategy – Tasks run one after another.
       • HierarchicalStrategy – ManagerAgent delegates tasks and monitors progress.
       • ConsensualStrategy – Agents agree on the execution order.
   - ManagerAgent must implement delegate_tasks(tasks).

6. Event-Driven Flows (Observer Pattern):
   - Develop an Event class and a Singleton EventManager.
   - Agents subscribe to and publish events (e.g., task completed, error, configuration change).
   - All agents must implement handle_event(event) to react to published events.

7. Tool Integration via Facade:
   - Create a ToolFacade class that exposes a unified method:
       • execute_tool(tool_name, *args, **kwargs)
   - Integrate the following tools:
       • WebScraperTool
       • FileReaderTool
       • CodeInterpreterTool
   - Support dynamic loading of custom tool plugins.

8. YAML Configuration & Self-Updating:
   - Use YAML files (e.g., config.yaml) to define settings for agents, tasks, orchestration, tools, and external integrations.
   - Write a configuration loader that validates settings with pydantic.
   - Implement a file watcher (e.g., with watchdog) to detect changes to the YAML files.
   - On detecting a change, automatically reload configuration and hot-swap modules (self-updating behavior).

9. External Integrations & Model Flexibility:
   - Define an abstract LLMInterface with:
       • process_text(text: str) → str
       • generate_response(prompt: str) → str
   - Implement OpenAILLM (primary) and CohereLLM (fallback).
   - Integrate Weaviate for vector database operations (insert, search, update, delete).

10. Production-Grade Features:
    - Implement robust error handling (try/except with retries per retry_policy).
    - Use centralized logging and telemetry; integrate a LoggingAgent and Telemetry module.
    - Maintain state management for each agent and a central state manager.
    - Secure all inputs and manage secrets via environment variables.
    - Use Dependency Injection to decouple components.

11. Test Case Generation & Mapping Pipeline:
    - Define the explicit process flow:
         a. User Interaction: A test manager uploads wireframes and submits test requirements via a UI or API.
         b. RequirementInputAgent: Receives, cleans, and validates raw test requirement text; stores uploaded wireframes as artifacts.
         c. NLPParsingAgent: Uses the LLM to parse cleaned text, extracting structured details (primary action, target object, expected outcome).
         d. TestCaseMappingAgent: Generates a formatted test case (Gherkin/Zephyr Scale format) from the structured data.
         e. ValidationAgent: Validates that the generated test case includes required elements (e.g., “Given”, “When”, “Then”).
         f. ChangeDetectionAgent: Continuously monitors stored wireframes/requirements for updates.
         g. TestCaseUpdateAgent: Upon detecting changes, triggers re-generation of test cases.
         h. StorageIntegrationAgent: Stores validated test cases in Zephyr Scale and a vector database for semantic search.
         i. QueryInterfaceAgent: Provides a natural language query interface for retrieving test case information.
         j. FlowOrchestratorAgent: Oversees the complete pipeline and ensures proper data flow.
         k. LoggingAgent: Logs each step for auditing, debugging, and performance monitoring.

12. Testing & Zephyr Integration:
    - Provide unit tests for all modules (agents, task management, orchestration, events, tools, and test case pipeline).
    - Develop integration tests that simulate the complete workflow from user input to test case storage.
    - Expose endpoints or CLI commands for manual testing with Zephyr.

13. Advanced Design Patterns & Code Quality:
    - Implement the following patterns:
         • Factory Pattern: For dynamic creation of agents and tasks from YAML.
         • Singleton Pattern: For EventManager and ConfigManager.
         • Decorator Pattern: For logging, caching, and error handling wrappers.
         • Dependency Injection: To decouple modules and ease testing.
    - All code must include inline comments, follow PEP8, and be formatted (e.g., using Black).
