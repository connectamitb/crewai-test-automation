Crafting a detailed list

I’m compiling a comprehensive list of agents, tasks, tools, flows, prompts, and other details to ensure a thorough understanding of the coding process.

Below is a comprehensive bulleted list summarizing the design aspects for our CrewAI-based Manual Test Agent. This includes the agents, their tasks, the tools each task uses, the overall flow, and how prompts (prompt engineering) are integrated—covering everything we’ve discussed.

Agents and Their Roles
Requirement Input Agent:

Role: Capture and sanitize raw test requirements from the user.
Tasks:
Receive input via UI, API, or console.
Clean and normalize the text (remove extra spaces, validate input).
Forward the cleaned requirement to the next agent.
NLP Parsing Agent:

Role: Extract key information (action, object, expected outcome) from the raw requirement using natural language understanding.
Tasks:
Process the input using an LLM (e.g., GPT-4) or NLP library.
Use prompt engineering to instruct the LLM on what details to extract.
Structure the extracted information into a standard format (e.g., dictionary).
Tools:
LLM APIs (OpenAI, Hugging Face Transformers).
NLP libraries (spaCy, NLTK).
Text preprocessing utilities.
Prompts:
“Extract the primary action, target object, and expected outcome from the following requirement: [requirement text].”
Test Case Mapping Agent:

Role: Convert the structured data from the NLP Parsing Agent into formatted test cases.
Tasks:
Receive structured output from the NLP Parsing Agent.
Map the data into a pre-defined template (e.g., Gherkin or Zephyr Scale format).
Optionally use an LLM (with prompt engineering) to refine or dynamically generate the test case text.
Tools:
Template engines (Jinja2 or simple string formatting).
Static templates stored as configuration (JSON/YAML).
LLM integration for context-aware generation (optional).
Prompts:
“Using the following data, generate a Gherkin-formatted test case: Action: [x], Object: [y], Expected Outcome: [z].”
For multi-format outputs, additional prompts to tailor the format (e.g., “Now output in Zephyr Scale format with additional metadata.”)
Validation Agent:

Role: Ensure the generated test case is complete, consistent, and adheres to required formats.
Tasks:
Check for mandatory elements (e.g., presence of “Given”, “When”, “Then” in Gherkin).
Run rule-based validations and consistency checks.
Return validation status and error messages if needed.
Tools:
Regular expressions and rule-based validation libraries.
Prompts:
(Typically not using LLM) – standard rules, e.g., “Ensure test case contains all required sections.”
Storage/Integration Agent:

Role: Store or push the validated test case into a test management system.
Tasks:
Accept the validated test case.
Convert it into the required format for external systems (e.g., JSON for API calls).
Use API connectors to store the test case (e.g., to Zephyr Scale or Jira).
Tools:
HTTP libraries (e.g., Requests in Python).
API connectors for Zephyr Scale/Jira.
Prompts:
(No LLM call required) – purely technical integration.
Logging Agent:

Role: Record each step of the process for debugging and auditing.
Tasks:
Log input receipt, parsed data, mapped test case, validation outcomes, and storage status.
Provide real-time alerts for errors or anomalies.
Tools:
Logging frameworks (Python’s logging module).
Monitoring/alerting tools (e.g., Slack integration, ELK Stack).
Prompts:
(No LLM call required) – standard logging practices.
Flow Orchestrator (Crew Kickoff):

Role: Coordinate the execution of the entire flow by instantiating and sequencing all agents.
Tasks:
Instantiate each agent.
Define the order of execution (Requirement Input → NLP Parsing → Test Case Mapping → Validation → Storage).
Manage asynchronous or parallel execution if multiple inputs are processed.
Tools:
Orchestration frameworks (custom orchestration, Celery for asynchronous tasks).
Task scheduling and error handling routines.
Prompts:
(No LLM call required) – oversees overall flow control.
Overall Flow
Capture & Preprocessing:
Requirement Input Agent gathers and cleans raw test requirement.
Natural Language Processing:
NLP Parsing Agent uses LLM with prompt engineering to extract key details and structures the data.
Test Case Generation:
Test Case Mapping Agent uses the structured data to generate test cases in desired formats (leveraging LLM if necessary for refinement).
Validation:
Validation Agent ensures the test case meets all format and content standards.
Storage:
Storage/Integration Agent pushes the final, validated test case to external systems.
Logging & Reporting:
Logging Agent records all events, errors, and outputs.
Orchestration:
Flow Orchestrator (Crew Kickoff) coordinates all the agents, ensuring the proper sequence and handling errors.
Additional Considerations
LLM-to-Tool Decision Making:
In the NLP Parsing and optionally the Test Case Mapping Agent, the LLM can be prompted to decide if further tool calls are necessary (e.g., for clarifications or additional context) based on conditions detected in the input.
Prompt Engineering:
Clearly defined prompts guide the LLM for both extraction and generation tasks, ensuring the output is as expected.
Flexibility for Multiple Formats:
The Test Case Mapping Agent can generate outputs in various formats (e.g., Gherkin, Zephyr Scale) by using different templates or prompts based on the requirement.
This comprehensive list covers the design of the system, detailing each agent's responsibilities, the specific tasks they perform, the tools they employ, the flow of data, and the integration of prompt engineering to leverage LLM capabilities. This is the blueprint for what we’re coding in our CrewAI-based Manual Test Agent framework.
